# CREDITS

- Seconb (Primary developer)
- AndrewDarkyy (https://github.com/AndrewDarkyy) (https://discord.gg/hH62fKGJnv) (Co-developer, contributed many features such as aim smoothening and checking if Roblox is open. NOT OFFICIALLY A DEVELOPER AT THIS TIME)
- Befia/Taylor (Contributed some bugfixes and comments to explain certain areas of code, and added basic error handling. Not an actual developer for the project though)
- Whoswhip ( Added 4 lines of code to add the color red )

# FEATURES

- Aimbot based on the outlines around enemies in Arsenal, and Aimblox (Arsenal and Aimblox only at this time, but if you know of another **ROBLOX** game that uses color outlines and is popular, tell Seconb!
- Triggerbot (automatically shoots enemies if enabled!)
- Adjustable aim (where it aims like their head or their body, and the speed and distance it does that from)
- Easy configuration via a file!
- Simplified installation
- Many choices for enemy outline colors!
- Doesn't require Windows Defender off like other cheats! (probably, lol)

# USAGE GUIDE

- Video tutorial coming soon

- Windows 10/11 only, stretched/non-native resolutions may have issues. Turn off "Mouse Acceleration" in Windows.

- Download from the Releases page: https://github.com/whoswhip/Aimblox-Colorbot/releases/

- Extract everything to a folder

- Change your config by going into the 'internal' folder then finding config.ini and modifying it in Notepad

- Run aimsource.exe

- Go into settings and turn on "Auto Hide Nametags", this prevents it from locking onto the nametags when on red.

- Use the colorbot. Note: Not required at all, but turning off Kill Effects, Ragdolls, and Shadows while turning on Basic Skins and Disable Bloom is recommended.

# USE FROM SOURCE (NOT FOR NORMAL USERS, DEVELOPERS ONLY)

- https://streamable.com/wydt64 <-- Video guide (read what's below before you watch it though)

- Windows 10/11 Only! May have issues on some stretched or otherwise unusual resolutions (i.e 1152x852 or 1366x768). 1080p, 1440p, or 4k is recommended. Mouse Acceleration should be turned off for best results.

- Bloxstrap support is not guaranteed (True fullscreen), if you have issues using Bloxstrap then try the regular verson of Web Roblox. If Web Roblox doesn't work then try Bloxstrap. UWP users may also face problems.

- Download the Source code, install Python from this link: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe and check "Add Python.exe to PATH" before actually installing. Then run installer.bat.

- Enable "Enemy Color Outlines" in Arsenal settings

- Drag each R G B slide in the settings all the way to the right, then back to the left to fix a bug in Arsenal.

- Change them to the color you choose in the config.ini. Your options are Green, Yellow, Pink/Magenta/Purple and Blue. Capitalization is unimportant as long as you spell the color correctly.

- Note: When using pink/magenta/purple, make sure that you change the crosshair color as the default is the same color as the enemies. Otherwise, the aimbot's not gonna work.

- Once you set the config with the color and did the color in Arsenal settings, open aimsource.py.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

- Do not contact me on Discord with your troubles. Go to https://discord.gg/hH62fKGJnv or use the "Issues" tab at the top of this page.

- Aim shaky? Lower your speed
  
- Crashing/Instantly closes when opened? Open CMD by typing CMD in the Windows Search bar (press the Windows Key), then copy the path to the folder where your colorbot is, and type cd path/to/the/colorbot into CMD. Next, type "python aimsource.py" or whatever you named the .py file.

- Not aiming at all? Make sure you set the color correctly. You must FULLY slide the R G B bar under "Enemy Color Outlines". Also make sure you did the part where you slide each color bar fully to the right then fully to the left before setting the correct color (fixes an Arsenal bug). If that doesn't work, try exiting Bloxstrap and using normal roblox, or if you're on normal Roblox try Bloxstrap. If this doesn't work, try uninstalling Python and installing a completely different version. By default, the colorbot uses 3.10, but try 3.11, 3.9, or 3.12. When installing, make sure you check "Add Python.EXE to PATH", then after installing Python run installer.bat again. If you are using the UWP, try using the web version. Please also ensure that Valorant, FACEIT, or any EAC-protected games are closed. (These anti-cheats either block or will ban you for using this script even though you are not actively using it in their game)
